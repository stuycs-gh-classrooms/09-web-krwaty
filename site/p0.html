    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Judy Hopps is a determined bunny cop. From a young age, she dreams of becoming a police in the heart of the city, Zootopia. 
    People around her, whether that'd be her parents, her childhood classmates, her instructors, or even her superiors and colleagues at work, were always looking down on her due to her small size and passive nature as a bunny. 
    However, she never let them get to her and worked non-stop towards her dream, graduating at the top of her class.
    Her passion for justice grew from her childhood, helping her fellow prey friends out against predator bullies.
    This carries onto her occupation as she challenges herself to solve a missing animal case within the time restriction of 48 hours.</p>
    <h2>Major Moments</h2>

    <p>1. Judy stands up for her bullied prey companions. When Gideon Gray (a fox) stole some kids' tickets at a carnival, Judy immediately jumped into action.
    Though her size was much smaller, she stood up against the fox and even got the tickets back.</p>
