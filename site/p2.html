    <h1>Plot Summary</h1>
    <img src="images/plot1.png" width="400px">
    <h2>The Beginning</h>
    <p>The movie starts off in the setting of a play. Judy and her classmates act out their dreams, and show how they can be anything they want to be in Zootopia despite their natures.
    The play ends and Judy and her parents walk through the festival while her parents discourage her from becoming a police.
    Amoung their bickering, Judy runs off when she sees Gideon Gray steal her classmates' won tickets. 
    Gideon laughs her off and puts her dream down, even scratching her on the cheek when she doesn't stand down. He walks away satisfied but Judy has stealthly stolen the tickets back.
    </p>
    <h2>Training Time</h2>
    <p>Judy goes to police academy where she realizes the difference between herself and the other trainees. 
    When they're training on the course, she falls behind. When they're matched up against one another, she doesn't even stand a chance. She can't even get on a toilet without the need to jump up (and then fall into the toilet). 
    Instead of letting this defeat her, she trains twice as hard as everybody else.
    Soon enough, we see her placing first in all the courses. Using tricks and techniques to outmatch the much larger animals.
    At the end, they've reached their graduation and Judy even received valedictorian, becoming the first bunny cop. </p>
    <h2>The Real Beginning</h2>
    <p>Despite everything, Judy finally moved to Zootopia. But on the first day of her job at the police force, she's put on parking duty/metermaid. 
    Nevertheless, she works hard as a meter maid when she sees a suspicious looking fox walking into an elephant popsicle store.
    She follow him and sees him and his son getting denied when trying to buy a popsicle.
    Judy helps him purchase one but after they parted ways, the fox and his "son" get to work.
    They melt the large popsicle and make it into smaller "pawsicles" which is sold to tiny hamsters, then selling the popsicle stick as "redwood".</p>
