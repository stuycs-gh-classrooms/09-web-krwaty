    <h1>Plot Summary</h1>
    <img src="images/plot1.png" width="400px">

    <h2>TLDR</h2>
    <p>Judy Hopps becomes a police and takes on a case to find a missing otter. She blackmails Nick Wilde using his confession of illegally selling stuff and they work together. 
      They find out the base where the missing animals are being kept and lock the mayor up for his involvement.
      Judy says that possibly the reason for all these animals going feral is due to a reversion back to primitive predator instincts. Nick, being a fox, feels like their partnership can't continue and leaves.
    Judy quits the ZPD after sending the city into panic and segregation of predators and prey. She hears about a vital clue that they missed during the investigation and goes back to find Nick.
    They make up and confiscate the material making predators go savage. Nick joins the ZPD as the first fox cop.</p>

    <h2>The Real Beginning</h2>
    <p>Despite everything, Judy finally moved to Zootopia. But on the first day of her job at the police force, she's put on parking duty/metermaid. 
    Nevertheless, she works hard as a meter maid when she sees a suspicious looking fox walking into an elephant popsicle store.
    She follow him and sees him and his son getting denied when trying to buy a popsicle.
    Judy helps him purchase one but after they parted ways, the fox and his "son" get to work.
    They melt the large popsicle and make it into smaller "pawsicles" which is sold to tiny hamsters, then selling the popsicle stick as "redwood".</p>
   
    <h2>The Case</h2>
    <p>
    Judy gets in trouble with her supervisor for chasing a weasle who stole from a flower shop since her post was a meter maid.
    She takes Ms. Otterton's case in the heat of the moment and is given 48 hours to find Mr. Otterton.
    Blackmailing Nick with his confession of illegally selling pawsicled and "red wood", they work on the case.
    They
      <ol>investigate the car Mr. Otterton was last seen in</ol>
      <ol>go to the jungle biome to talk to the driver</ol>
      <ol>escape from the driver who went insane</ol>
      <ol>check the city's cameras to see where the driver was taken</ol>
      <ol>find the base of the night-howlers (wolves) and where all 13 missing animals were including Mr. Otterton</ol>
    And at last, the case seems to be done. 
    All the animals are in rehab and Judy takes a press conference with the help of Nick. 
    She offers him an application form for the ZPD saying it would be great to have Nick as her partner.
    </p>
  
    <h2>The Breakoff</h2>
    <p>Judy goes on stage to answer the reporter's questions and talks about the theory of all 12 animals reverting to their primitive ways as they were all predators.
    Nick, off-stage, is shocked at what she's saying and flashback to other kids putting a muzzle on him during the first Junior Ranger Scouts meeting.
    When Judy gets off stage, he contronts her and asks her if she really wants a predator as a partner after what she said.
    He pretends to try to attack her and she instinctively pulls out her fox repellant spray.
    This gets the message across to Nick and he hands his application back to her and leaves.
    Judy quits her job at the police force after seeing the chaos she brought to the city. Prey are now scared of predators and distance themselves even from their friends.
      The bias and sterotype towards predators have increased while Judy is being viewed as a hero by prey. She returns and works on the family farm.</p>
    
    <h2>The End</h2>
    <p>When Gideon Gray visits, he reminds the kids to stay off the nighthowlers and this is when she realized that she got the clue wrong. 
    Nighthowlers was the name for the flowers that made the animals go savage. She seeks out Nick and cries while apologizing.
    Nick forgives her and they set out to find the guy in charge of making these nighthowler darts. Fight and escape scene ensues in a train station.
    Judy and Nick take the evidence and were about to hand it over to Mayor Bellweather (a fellow prey friend) until they decided she was suspicious.
    Bellweather takes the evidence (nighthowlers dart gun) and shoots Nick who pretends to go savage and eat Judy. Turns out, they replaced the darts with blueberries from the farm.
    The ZPD shows up and arrests Mayor Bellweather and yay happy ending!</p>
